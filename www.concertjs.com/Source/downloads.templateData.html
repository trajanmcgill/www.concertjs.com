	<h3>Downloading ConcertJS</h3>
	<p>Full and minified forms of each release of ConcertJS are available for download below.</p>
	<h4>Using ConcertJS in Your Own Projects</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>ConcertJS is freely available for use in any project, including commercial projects, under the MIT License. Find out more <a href="license.html">here</a>.</li>
		<li>Using ConcertJS: Please do not link directly to the below files. Instead, download and include them in your own project. Why?
			<ul>
				<li>
					Making your web site depend on someone else's web site is a poor idea.
					If you link here instead of hosting the file on your own site, then whenever my site is slow or unavailable, your site is broken.
					You have no control over the reliability of my site. Don't make your site's reliability dependent on things you can't control.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is possible (if unlikely&mdash; this depends on how you are using the library) that you could run into errors caused by cross-site scripting restrictions
					when trying to pull the script from one place and use it on a web site hosted on another. Because XSS restrictions are implemented differently per browser,
					this could be happening to your users without your being aware.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is more courteous to me and to other users of ConcertJS: I can have a better idea of how many people are downloading this library,
					and this site won't get bogged down by having to use its bandwidth to serve to every user of every single application out there using ConcertJS.
				</li>
			</ul>
