        Adds a set of transformations (i.e., changes applied to objects over time) to the sequence.<br><p class="ExplanationParagraph"><strong>Terminology:</strong></p><p class="ExplanationParagraph">-A <em>transformation</em> is a single change applied over time to a single feature of a single object. Its properties include which object to modify and what feature of it will be altered, a start time and starting value, and end time and ending value. For instance, a transformation may represent changing the "width" style of a DIV element from "100px" at time 1000 to "200px" at time 2000.</p><p class="ExplanationParagraph">-A <em>sequence</em> is a collection of transformations that are to be applied together as a group.</p><p class="ExplanationParagraph">-A <em>target object</em> is anything that will be modified by a transformation (e.g., a DOM element or a JavaScript object).</p><p class="ExplanationParagraph">-A <em>target feature</em> is the aspect of the target object that will be modified (e.g., for a DOM element this might be "width").</p><p class="ExplanationParagraph">-A <em>unit</em> is an optional (initially defaults to <code>null</code>) string appended to a calculated value when applying it to a target feature(e.g., for a DOM style property this might be "px").</p><p class="ExplanationParagraph">-A <em>calculator</em> is a function that looks at the start and end values of a target feature and calculates a current value to applybased on the current distance along the timeline. Ordinarily this is set to one of the pre-defined calculator functions in the <a href="Concert.Calculators.html">Concert.Calculators</a> namespace(initially defaulting to <code>Concert.Calculators.Linear</code>), but can also be a custom function, as explained further below.</p><p class="ExplanationParagraph">-An <em>applicator</em> is a function that takes the values computed by the calculator function and applies them to the target feature.For instance, different applicators would be used for setting JavaScript object properties, DOM element styles, or SVG element attributes.Ordinarily this is set to one of the pre-defined applicator functions in the <a href="Concert.Applicators.html">Concert.Applicators</a> namespace(initially defaulting to <code>Concert.Applicators.Property</code>), but can also be a custom function, as explained further below.</p><p class="ExplanationParagraph">-An <em>easing</em> is a function which modifies the rate at which a transformation moves from beginning to end.For instance, it may progress steadily from the start time to the end time, or it may accelerate and decelerate to make motion appear smoother.Ordinarily this is set to one of the pre-defined easing functions in the <a href="Concert.EasingFunctions.html">Concert.EasingFunctions</a> namespace(initially defaulting to <code>Concert.EasingFunctions.ConstantRate</code>) but can also be a custom function, as explained further below.</p><p class="ExplanationParagraph">Note: The easing function could easily be confused with the calculator function, because many animation libraries combine these two concepts.Here, however, they can be set independently. Essentially, a calculator function, given a start value, an end value, and the current time (in the form of a fractional distancebetween the start time and end time of the transformation), calculates a current value to apply. The easing function is what computes the current time that will be passed intothe calculator function, allowing the rate at which a transformation proceeds to change over time. The reason for separating these becomes apparent when we consider that differenttypes of calculation are necessary for different types of features. A function calculating an animated transition from one RGB color value to another uses a different algorithm thanone calculating the animation of a simple, numeric value, for instance, or a complex calculator function that takes multiple inputs and calculates rotational movement.Because Concert.js allows anything at all to be animated, it supports the ability to choose any method of calculating values, and then (regardless of which one is used)specifying any easing function to alter the rate at which the animation takes place. Easing functions are specified at the level of the transformation (not the full sequence,although it is possible to set a default easing function for a sequence), so a single sequence can contain different transformations using a different easing functions.</p>

            <td class="description last">An object or array describing a set of changes which will be applied at specified times to specified target objects.(A target object being anything that will be modified by the sequence, such as a DOM element or a JavaScript object.)The <code>transformationSet</code> parameter is either a single object whose properties define a set of transformations, or an array of such objects.Certain of the properties (as indicated below) are optional, and each sequence maintains its own settings for what default values will be applied to transformationswhen the optional properties are not defined. (Note: these defaults are applied at the time the transformations are added, not at run-time, so changing the defaultsfor a sequence will never alter transformations which have already been added to that sequence.)<br><br>The expected layout of the object passed into this method is defined as follows (also see examples below):<pre><strong>transformationSet</strong> = <em>TransformationsObject</em>OR<strong>transformationSet</strong> = [<em>TransformationsObject<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>TransformationsObject<sub>2</sub></em>, ...]<strong><em>TransformationsObject</em></strong> =  {      target: <em>TargetObjectDefinition</em>,      AND/OR      targets: [<em>TargetObjectDefinition<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>TargetObjectDefinition<sub>2</sub></em>, ...]      feature: <em>FeatureDefinition</em>,      [unit: <em>UnitDefinition</em>,] // If absent, uses sequence's default value      [applicator: <em>ApplicatorFunction</em>,] // If absent, uses sequence's default value      [calculator: <em>CalculatorFunction</em>,] // If absent, uses sequence's default value      [easing: <em>EasingFunction</em>,] // If absent, uses sequence's default value      keyframes: <em>KeyframesDefinition</em>      OR      segments: <em>SegmentDefinition</em> OR [<em>SegmentDefinition<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>SegmentDefinition<sub>2</sub></em>, ...]  };<strong><em>TargetObjectDefinition</em></strong> = The object to be modified by these transformations.Often this will be a DOM object, but it can be anything at all. Multiple targets canbe specified, by using the <code>targets</code> (plural) property, as a shorthand method ofduplicating the transformation definitions to target all the included target objects.<strong><em>FeatureDefinition</em></strong> = The feature of the target object which will be modified, OR anarray of such features. In most cases, this will be a string (for example, whenanimating a DOM style, this might be "width") or an array of strings. Arrays areallowed as a shorthand method of defining multiple features, values, and unitstogether in a more compact notation. The first feature in the array will bematched with the first unit and the first value in those arrays, and so on. Seebelow samples for an example of using arrays in this way.<strong><em>UnitDefinition</em></strong> = A string to be appended to calculated values before they are appliedto the target (for example, when animating a DOM style, this might be "px"), OR anarray of such strings. Arrays are allowed as a shorthand method of defining multiplefeatures, values, and units together in a more compact notation. The first unit inthe array will be matched with the first feature and the first value in those arrays,and so on. See below samples for an example of using arrays in this way. Use <em>null</em>if nothing should be appended to the calculated values for this transformation.<strong><em>ApplicatorFunction</em></strong> = Function used to apply the calculated current value to thefeature. Because different types of features (e.g., DOM element styles as contrastedto plain JavaScript object properties) are applied in different ways, differentapplicator functions are needed. This can be set to one of the functions defined inthe <a href="Concert.Applicators.html">Concert.Applicators</a> namespace, or to any function with the signature:  <em>function applicatorFunction(target, feature, value, unit)</em>See below examples for a sample of a custom applicator.<strong><em>CalculatorFunction</em></strong> = Function used to calculate a current value to apply to the targetfeature. This can be set to one of the functions defined in the <a href="Concert.Calculators.html">Concert.Calculators</a>namespace, or to any function returning an approprate value for this transformation'starget feature and having the signature:  <em>function calculatorFunction(distanceFraction, startValue, endValue, addlProperties)</em>See below examples for a sample of a custom calculator.<strong><em>EasingFunction</em></strong> = Function used to compute the current time (as a fractionalproportion of the distance traversed, from 0 to 1, between the start time andend time of the transformation). This can be set to one of the functions definedin the <a href="Concert.EasingFunctions.html">Concert.EasingFunctions</a> namespace, or toany function returning a value from 0 to 1 and having the signature:  <em>function easingFunction(startTime, endTime, currentTime)</em>See below examples for a sample of a custom easing function.<strong><em>KeyframesDefinition</em></strong> =  {      times: <em>KeyframeTimesArray</em>,      [values: <em>KeyframeValuesArray</em>,]      OR      [valueGenerators: <em>ValueGeneratorsArray</em>]  };<strong><em>SegmentDefinition</em></strong> =   {      t0: <em>TimeDefinition</em>, // Start time of this transformation      t1: <em>TimeDefinition</em>, // End time of this transformation      v0: <em>ValueDefinition</em>, // Value applied at the start time      v1: <em>ValueDefinition</em>, // Value applied at the end time      OR      v0Generator: <em>ValueGenerator</em>, // Function to calculate v0      v1Generator: <em>ValueGenerator</em>, // Function to calculate v1      [calculator: <em>CalculatorFunction</em>,] // If absent, falls back to the calculator      // defined at the <em>TransformationsObject</em> level; if also absent there, to the      // sequence's default calculator.      [easing: <em>EasingFunction</em>,] // If absent, falls back to the easing function      // defined at the <em>TransformationsObject</em> level; if also absent there, to the      // sequence's default easing.      [unit: <em>UnitDefinition</em>,] // If absent, falls back to the unit defined at the      // <em>TransformationsObject</em> level; if also absent there, to the sequence's      // default unit.  };<strong><em>KeyframeTimesArray</em></strong> = An array of the form [<em>TimeDefinition<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>TimeDefinition<sub>2</sub></em>, ...].This defines the timeline points used as keyframes for this transformation series,to be matched up with the values in the corresponding <em>KeyframeValuesArray</em>. A nullelement has the effect of breaking the keyframe string into two segments. For example,the array [0, 100, 1000, 2000] defines a constant flow of transition with fourkeyframes. The array [0, 100, null, 1000, 2000], on the other hand, defines a flowthat is broken in two pieces: one animated segment with keyframes at time 0 and 100,then no further animation at all until until time 1000, followed by another periodof animation between the keyframes at times 1000 and 2000.<strong><em>KeyframeValuesArray</em></strong> = An array of the form [<em>ValueDefinition<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>ValueDefinition<sub>2</sub></em>, ...].This defines the values applied at each keyframe point, as matched up with the keyframepoints defined in the corresponding <em>KeyframeTimesArray</em>. Note that null valuesappearing in this array work exactly the same way (and should match up with) nullvalues in the <em>KeyframeTimesArray</em>. Both arrays must have the same number of elements.<strong><em>ValueGeneratorsArray</em></strong> = An array of the form [<em>ValueGenerator<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>ValueGenerator<sub>2</sub></em>, ...].This defines the functions that calculate values applied at each keyframe point, asmatched up with the keyframe points defined in the corresponding <em>KeyframeTimesArray</em>.<strong><em>TimeDefinition</em></strong> = A number indicating a point along the sequence timeline. Whensynchronizing to a media object or running by the system clock, this should ordinarilybe specified as a number of milliseconds (1/1000's of a second). Otherwise, there is norestriction; it simply indicates a numeric point on the overall timeline, with noparticular unit implied. For instance, a sequence could be synchronized to the valueof a slider or other user control, in which case this number would just be anythingfrom the minimum to the maximum values of that control.<strong><em>ValueDefinition</em></strong> = A value to be applied to the target object feature, or an array ofsuch values. This value can be of any type, although it needs to be one appropriate tothe target feature, calculator, and applicator being used. If a unit is specified, thevalue will be treated as a string and the unit will be appended to it beforeapplication. Arrays are allowed as a shorthand method of defining multiple features,values, and units together in a more compact notation. The first value in the arraywill be matched with the first unit and the first feature in those arrays, and so on.See below samples for an example of using arrays in this way.<strong><em>ValueGenerator</em></strong> = A function which returns a valid <em>ValueDefinition</em> and has the signature:  <em>function generatorFunction(sequence)</em>This is a mechanism that allows specifying functions that will calculate start and endvalues for a transformation, instead of using fixed values determined at the time thetransformation is initially specified. This can be helpful if the same transformationwill be run more than once with different start and end values, such as a motion thatmight be repeated in more than one place on the screen at different times, or if thetransformation is being added to the sequence before the actual start and end valuesare yet known. This is not to be confused with a Calculator function. A Calculatortakes a start and end value along with the current time and calculates the currentvalue. This function, by contrast, is called prior to running the sequence anddetermines what the start and end values are that the Calculator will look at duringrun-time of the sequence. All of the value generator functions for an entire sequenceare called at once, either manually by calling the sequence's <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#generateValues">generateValues</a> method,or at the time the sequence is run, by specifying <code>true</code> for the <code>generateValues</code> optionwhen calling the <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#run">run</a>, <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#begin">begin</a>, <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#follow">follow</a>, or <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#syncTo">syncTo</a> methods.The generator function will be passed a reference to the sequence object containing thetransformation whose values are currently being generated.</pre></td>

        <h5>Examples</h5>
        
        <p class="code-caption">Example 1 Below: Single target object and feature, using keyframes, not relying on defaults. This would move a DOM object with id "someObject"by changing its "left" style value from "0px" to "60px" over the timeline period from time 1000 to 2000.</p>
    
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code>sequence.addTransformations({    target: document.getElementById("someObject"),    feature: "left",    unit: "px",    applicator: Concert.Applicators.Style,    calculator: Concert.Calculators.Linear,    easing: Concert.EasingFunctions.ConstantRate,    keyframes: { times: [1000, 2000], values: [0, 60] }  });    </code></pre>

        <p class="code-caption">Example 2 Below: This example demonstrates adding transformations for more than one target at a time, using both the"keyframes" and "segments" styles of definition, and using arrays for the target features and values. (An array could also have beenspecified for the "unit" property, but that isn't necessary if the same unit is being used for all the features as it is here.) Alsonote that the setDefaults method is being used to avoid having to specify common properties over and over again.This code would move the DOM object with id "someObject1" from position (0, 0) to (100, 200) from time 0 to 1000,and would change the width on the object with id "someObject2" from 75 to 150 and back to 75 again over the same time period.</p>
    
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code>sequence.setDefaults(  {    applicator: Concert.Applicators.Style,    calculator: Concert.Calculators.Linear,    easing: Concert.EasingFunctions.ConstantRate,    unit: "px"  });sequence.addTransformations(  [    {      target: document.getElementById("someObject1"),      feature: ["left", "top"],      keyframes: { times: [0, 1000], values: [[0, 0], [100, 200]] }    },    {      target: document.getElementById("someObject2"),      feature: "width",      segments:        [          { t0:   0, t1:  500,    v0:  75, v1: 150 },          { t0: 500, t1: 1000,    v0: 150, v1:  75 },        ]    }  ]);    </code></pre>

        <p class="code-caption">Example 3 Below: This example demonstrates using value generator functions instead of fixed values.This could would create a single transformation that animates the "left" property of the DOM element with ID "PhotonTorpedoBox".The animation runs from time 0 to time 1000, but the actual values are not yet known. Imagining that we're animating the firingof a torpedo from a ship whose location at the time the torpedo will be fired is not yet known, we set up functions that candetermine the proper start and end locations later. Then, whenever it is appropriate to determine and fix the actual numbers,we would call generateValues(), which calls the generator functions and stores the values returned to be used when the sequenceis run. (Or, if the generateValues option is specified with a value of true when running the sequence, generateValues() will becalled automatically at that time.) Also note, the QuadIn easing function is used here, which will cause the motion to speedup as it proceeds from beginning to end.</p>
    
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code>sequence.setDefaults(  {    applicator: Concert.Applicators.Style,    calculator: Concert.Calculators.Linear,    easing: Concert.EasingFunctions.QuadIn,    unit: "px"  });sequence.addTransformations(  {    target: document.getElementById("PhotonTorpedoBox"),    feature: "left",    segments:      [{        t0: 0,        t1: 1000,        v0Generator:          function ()          {            var ship = document.getElementById("SpaceshipBox");            return (ship.offsetLeft + ship.offsetWidth);          },        v1Generator:          function ()          {            var ship = document.getElementById("SpaceshipBox");            return (ship.offsetLeft + ship.offsetWidth + 1000);          }      }]  });// ... sometime later:sequence.generateValues();</code></pre>

        <p class="code-caption">Example 3b Below: Shown here is the relevant portion of the last example modified to use keyframes notation instead ofsegments notation.</p>

The code shows a custom applicator function that could be used if we wanted touse a jQuery object containing multiple elements as a target object. <strong>Note that Concert.js does NOT depend in anyway on jQuery; this example merely showsusing the two libraries in conjunction.</strong> The custom calculator function also makes use of jQuery, and shows howa custom calculator could be used to generate truly dynamic values- in this case, it keeps the calculated value lockedto the width of a particular DOM element. The custom easing function shown here causes the animation to proceed athalf-speed for two thirds of the time, then double-speed for the final third of the time.</p>

        Creates a duplicate of a sequence, allowing a sequence to be defined once and then cloned to apply to any number of different sets of target objects.For example, the same series of animated motions might be applied to numerous on-screen elements.Since each sequence may contain transformations targeting numerous different objects, this is accomplished by passing in a function that,when passed a transformation target from the original sequence, returns the corresponding object to be targeted in the new sequence.(Note that one useful way of doing this easily is to set the targets of the original sequence to be strings or integers instead of actual objects. The original sequence then just becomes essentially a dummy sequence with placeholder targets that your function can easily identify and use for looking up substitute target objects.)This method is capable of duplicating nearly every aspect of the original sequence, including jumping to the same current point in time and evencloning its running or non-running status if desired. (To change the target objects of a sequence without creating a new one, see the <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#retarget">retarget</a> method.)

        Indexes a sequence. This function is run automatically (if necessary) any time a sequence is run or the <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#seek">seek</a> method is called.However, for very large sequences (large enough that indexing would cause a noticable lag), it may be desirable to manually control when indexing takes place(that is, to pre-index the sequence), so that seeking or running will begin instantly. Once indexed, a sequence (or any sequences cloned from it) will not needto be indexed again unless new transformations are added to it.<br><br><strong>Explanation of Indexing:</strong> Concert.js sequences can consist of very large numbers of transformations applied to numerous target objects,with the ability to seek extremely quickly to any point in the sequence. This is what makes it useful for synchronizing to other things (such as audio or video)and for other situations that require arbitrary seeking, running at different speeds or in either direction, or other uses that don't conform to a simple,run-once-forward-only-at-normal-speed scenario. What makes this possible is an internal data structure that optimizes for quickly finding the correct valueto apply to every target feature of every one of the objects being animated, at any point along the timeline. This internal structure involves a set of pre-built indexesof timeline segments. Much like indexes on database tables, this vastly speeds up run-time lookup performance by doing some processing ahead of time to analyze and organize the data.Every sequence needs to be indexed once (or again after any new transformations are added). Running or seeking to any point in an un-indexed sequence will cause indexing to take placeautomatically, or indexing can be run manually with this method. In many cases, the automatic indexing will run fast enough that manually running the indexer is not necessary.

        Seeks to the specified point along the sequence timeline. If the <code>time</code> value is less than the sequence's start time or greater than the sequence's end time,the resulting behavior will be defined by the sequence's "before" or "after" repeating behavior settings, as controlled by the <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#setBefore">setBefore</a> and<a href="Concert.Sequence.html#setAfter">setAfter</a> methods or by the options passed into the <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#run">run</a>, <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#begin">begin</a>,<a href="Concert.Sequence.html#follow">follow</a>, or <a href="Concert.Sequence.html#syncTo">syncTo</a> methods. The default behavior, if none has explicitly been specified, is<a href="Concert.Repeating.html">Concert.Repeating.None</a>, which seeks to the sequence start time for any <code>time</code> value less than or equal to the sequence'sstart time, and to the end time for any <code>time</code> value greater than or equal to the sequence's end time. The <code>useSoleControlOptimization</code> option,when set to true, enhances run-time performance, but should only be used if nothing other than the Concert sequence will be modifying any target object properties that are modifiedby transformations in the sequence. Essentially it skips updating target object properties any time a newly calculated value is the same as the last one applied, which speeds upseek times especially when doing relatively slow things such as DOM updates, but which will not work if the target object property's value has been changed by something elsesince the last time the sequence object touched it.

This allows the sequence to remain synchronized to      the media even when it is paused, scrubbed, or the user skips around.</pre></td>
