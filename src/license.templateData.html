		<h3>requestAnimationFrame.js</h3>
		<p>
			The requestAnimationFrame.js shim distributed with Concert.js is not required for the use of Concert.js itself, but is supplied
			in case support is desired in your projects for extremely old browsers (roughly pre-2013, although some supported it earlier).
			This component is in the public domain and is freely usable in any way.
			See <a href="https://github.com/trajanmcgill/requestAnimationFrame.js/blob/master/LICENSE">this web page</a> for details.
