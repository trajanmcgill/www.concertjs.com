	<h4>What is Concert.js?</h4>
	<p>
		Concert.js is a JavaScript component for easily defining sequences of changes to CSS styles, DOM objects,
		or anything else that can be manipulated with JavaScript, and playing these sequences or synchronizing them
		with media playback, user interaction, or your own components. In short, it animates things, and if you want,
		it will precisely synchronize those animations with other things.
	</p>

	<h4>Why would I want to use this particular animation library?</h4>
	<p>
		Some of the things that make Concert.js handy include:
		<ul>
			<li>
				It is easy to work into your code, whatever your project structure.
				Concert.js supports simple script tag inclusion or any of the common module formats (AMD, CommonJS, and even ES Modules)
			</li>
			<li>
				It has intuitive syntax that is quick to learn and implement.
			</li>
			<li>
				Animation sequences are defined in ways which allow them to be easily programmatically generated and manipulated.
				Throw together an array of keyframes and positions, or an array of individual movement segments, whichever is easier for the job at hand,
				and drop it into the sequence object. Clone animations onto different targets. Create them before the objects they apply to even exist.
			</li>
			<li>
				One place Concert.js shines as compared to some other methods of animating is when you need synchronization.
				Want to manipulate the DOM in time with video, audio, or other animations happening simultaneously? No problem.
				Concert.js is highly optimized for very quick seek times, even with large numbers of items being animated,
				and its animations remain locked to their time source (whether that is the system clock or something else, such as an html video element).
				No more setting two things in motion at the same time and only hoping they stay running at the same rate all the way to the end.
			</li>
			<li>
				An MIT License means you can use it how you want.
			</li>
			<li>
				All the usual things you'd expect (e.g., assorted easing functions), and some things you might not,
				like rotational motion and animation of colors (including transparency).
			</li>
			<li>
				The easy-to-use animation engine can easily be applied to new things.
				Custom functions are supported for calculating complex values or applying them to any sort of target.
			</li>
		</ul>
